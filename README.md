# What should be the next directions for the  LearnOCaml platform?

## Purpose of this document

The LearnOCaml platform is currently used in several Universities (McGill, Lisbon, Toulouse, Perpignan, University of Paris, Sorbonne University, preparatory classes for scientific French schools, etc) and we get feedbacks from these users.
